# yolov8-indoor-object-detection
My final year project, trained data using YOLOv8s model.

I used YOLOv8s because it is one of the lightest model, after the n version, stands for nano (the lightest model weight).

I've pre-processed my data using Roboflow, an open-source platform. The data has been pre-processed and then trained using YOLOv8s pre-trained model.

Any inquiries regarding this repo, feel free to reach me out.
